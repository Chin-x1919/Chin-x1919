Nothing. Just a README on the profile.  
Must be **the README**.  

- I build **projects nobody asked for** but somehow still exits.  
- Proud creator of things like:  
  - **Anonymous Q&A** → secured by `?Key=Something`  
  - **CF-Calculator™** → a calculator that literally can’t math  
  - Breadboard chaos projects (because why not)
  - or something else

## Contribution Growth

- In 2024: Profile = graveyard ☠️  
- In 2025: **+2005% growth** (calculated using *CF-Calculator™* — yes, the one that doesn’t understand math).  

People who visit:  
> “Wtf is this, let’s check one project…”  
>  
> *ohh shiiittt you actually wasted hours making this??* 🤣

## Current Status
- Budget per project: IDK 
- Quality: questionable  
- License: MIT (aka do whatever, I don’t care)  
- Motto: **O P E N S O U R C E > T H I R D P A R T Y**

## NGL vs My Potato Project

- **NGL (corporate)**: polished app, real backend, database, iOS/Android, $$$  
- **Me**: one HTML file, Discord webhook, and a `?Key=Something`  

Cost: **< 0 USD**  
But hey, mine is **O P E N S O U R C E** ✨

If you came here expecting serious dev stuff, sorry.  
You just found a repo zoo of cursed HTML & JS.
