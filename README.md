# Hi, I’m Chin 👋  
i am a dev from thailand  

---

Nothing. Just a README on the profile.  
Must be **the README**.  

---

## 🛠️ What I Build
I make **projects nobody asked for** but somehow still exist:  
- **Anonymous Q&A** → secured by `?Key=Something`  
- **CF-Calculator™** → a calculator that literally can’t math  
- Breadboard chaos projects (because why not)  
- …or whatever cursed idea comes to mind  

---

## 📈 Contribution Growth
- In 2024: Profile = graveyard ☠️  
- In 2025: **+2005% growth**  
  (calculated using *CF-Calculator™* — yes, the one that doesn’t understand math)  

👀 People who visit:  
> “Wtf is this, let’s check one project…”  
>  
> *ohhh shiiittt you actually wasted hours making this??* 🤣  

---

## ⚡ Current Status
- Budget per project: IDK, probably less than a Red Bull  
- Quality: questionable at best  
- License: MIT (aka do whatever, I don’t care)  
- Motto: **O P E N S O U R C E > T H I R D P A R T Y**

If you came here expecting serious dev work, sorry.  
You just found a **repo zoo of cursed Project**.
