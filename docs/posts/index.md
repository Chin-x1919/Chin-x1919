## WTF is Oculink

Oculink is basically PcieX4 but outside you pc and you could plug whatever pcie stuff(ex:gpu,soundcard.thunderbolt,wifi card)
like an flashdrive but why are we selling this if they're a lot of this on aliexpress? no we're not seling it(yet) beacuse we're to broke
so this is blog padge when we got some budget we'll making an physical product that's simple,premium and affordable
